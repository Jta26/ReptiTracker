# ReptiTracker
Reptitracker is multiplatform app built with React-Native (Link) that assists reptile owners in taking care of their pets. The core functionality of the app is based around tracking specific data points that are common to most types of reptiles. The app consists of a authentication and data storage in Google's Firebase. Users will be able to add their reptiles to the app and get and set information about them. The most valuable feature to most reptile owners will be the reminders for push notifications, but there are other features centered around analysis of data. Thing such as feeding frequency, shedding rates, and cage temperatures will all be able to be tracked by the user and viewed on a chart.
